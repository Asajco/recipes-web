### Recipe web applicatoin version 

This was my first project that i did by my own with little help of my friend Luk치코(thanks to him this way) and im pretty happy to finally make something that atleast do something so Yeah.

### Services that i used

This is only front-end application and i used [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) framework. Third party libraries:


- [react-hook-from](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form)
- [react-spinner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners)


### Running the app:

First all the project dependencies need to be installed with `npm install --global yarn` command.<br>
Then you can run the application simply writing `yarn start`.
